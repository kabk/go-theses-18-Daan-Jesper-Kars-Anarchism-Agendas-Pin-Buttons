		The topic I am researching are the aesthetics and ideologies of the 80’s/90’s punk-rock movement and provocative contemporary design projects.

		What is the tactic behind the provocative aspect of punk-rock and how is it still being used in contemporary graphic design practices?

		Although the revolutionary and provocative aspect of graphic design appears to be a development of the 21st century, it is actually an aftermath of the 80’s/90’s punk-rock movement.

		Nowadays, with many political events that include injustice and fascism happening all around the world, the numbers of movements (or members of already existing movements) are growing fast. Where are we standing as educated political designers in this matter? During my research about the punk-rock movement I noticed that a lot of techniques and tactics, that were used to distribute the anti-fascist ideologies, are being used in contemporary graphic design practices. 

		By researching both topics, the punk-rock movement of the 80’s/90’s and being a political designer in this era, I want to show, and above all, prove that, design is an important factor, and maybe even a necessity for a movement just as it was provocative in the 80’s/90’s. I will gather information that will prove my statement by reading books, interview designers who were influenced by the punk-rock movement or its techniques, and make visual comparisons between then and now. 

		So far I noticed that the punk-rock aspect is not only found back in contemporary graphic design, but in design in general such as fashion, interior architecture and magazines. 

		I expect to find and reveal organized tactics and techniques that were used to create provocative visuals that lead to action.
