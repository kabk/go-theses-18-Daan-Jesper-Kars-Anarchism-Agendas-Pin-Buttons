			The field I'm interested in is the punk rock movement of the 80's/90's. Not only the music scene but the inner-core why this movement was created: to change the political agenda and get rid of fascism in general, by using different kinds of mediums to convey their message.

			<blockquote>Many comparisons can be found in graphic design nowadays. For instance: the DIY (do it yourself), taking position in society and letting others hear their voice. Once Hank Peirce wrote an article named: Punk is Dead. In that article he says: <span style="font-style:italic">Don't follow us, don't do what we did, just learn from our mistakes. Beware the traps of consumerism that we stepped into.</span> I believe that we, the (graphic) designers, are the movement that should follow up the punk rock movement.

			<br>
			<blockquote>By researching both topics, punk-rock movement & being a political designer in this era, I want to show and prove that we, the designers, are capable of creating changes. Maybe not completely, but I do believe that a good designed project can be the beginning of a change in society and maybe even cause a revolution.

			<blockquote>By researching both topics, the punk-rock movement of the 80’s/90’s and being a political designer in this era, I want to show, and above all, prove that, design is an important factor, and maybe even a necessity for a movement. Design itself maybe won’t start a riot, but I do believe that a good designed project can be the beginning of change in society and maybe even cause a revolution.

			The topic I am researching are the aesthetics and ideologies of the 80’s/90’s punk-rock movement and provocative contemporary design projects.
			
			<br>
			<blockquote>What is the tactic behind the provocative aspect of punk-rock and how is it still being used in contemporary graphic design practices?

			<br>
			<blockquote>Although the revolutionary and provocative aspect of graphic design appears to be a development of the 21st century, it is actually an aftermath of the 80’s/90’s punk-rock movement.

			<br>
			<blockquote>Nowadays, with many political events that include injustice and fascism happening all around the world, the numbers of movements (or members of already existing movements) are growing fast. Where are we standing as educated political designers in this matter? During my research about the punk-rock movement I noticed that a lot of techniques and tactics, that were used to distribute the anti-fascist ideologies, are being used in contemporary graphic design practices.

			<blockquote>By researching both topics, the punk-rock movement of the 80’s/90’s and being a political designer in this era, I want to show, and above all, prove that, design is an important factor, and maybe even a necessity for a movement just as it was provocative in the 80’s/90’s. I will gather information that will prove my statement by reading books, interview designers who were influenced by the punk-rock movement or its techniques, and make visual comparisons between then and now. 

			<br>
			<blockquote>So far I noticed that the punk-rock aspect is not only found back in contemporary graphic design, but in design in general such as fashion, interior architecture and magazines. 

			<br>
			<blockquote>I expect to find and reveal organized tactics and techniques that were used to create provocative visuals that lead to action.

			The aesthetics and agendas of 70’s and 80’s punk-rock movement were striking and provocative, not only nation wide but globally. Still nowadays the visual communication of the punk-rock movement is considered to be striking.
			
			<br>
			<blockquote>What were the tactics and methods that made the face of punk-rock so provocative and are those tactics and methods still relevant in contemporary provocative and activist design projects?

			<br>
			<blockquote>Although the revolutionary and provocative aspect of contemporary design projects appear to be a development of the 21st century, its methods and techniques are actually an aftermath of the 70’s/80’s punk-rock movement.

			<br>
			<blockquote>Nowadays, with many political events that include injustice and fascism happening all around the world, the numbers of movements (or members of already existing movements) are growing fast. Where are we standing as educated political designers in this matter, and how do we react on it? During my research about the punk-rock movement I noticed that a lot of techniques and tactics, that were used to distribute the anti-fascist ideologies, are being used in contemporary graphic design practices.

			<br>
			<blockquote>I use artworks that are provocative and try to strip it down to find out what elements it uses to be striking. Ones the elements are found I try to trace it back to find out where it comes from and what the psychology plays along. After that I try to compare the elements with contemporary provocative design projects or artworks to see if the methods from then are still relevant today. 

			<br>
			<blockquote>I found out that most contemporary provocative projects use the same methods as the punk-rock movement of the 70’s/80’s. In addition I discovered that it goes back even further to the period when dadaism was established. Most iconic punk-rock objects are swallowed by consumerism and therefore lost their political load and are left for nothing more than just an aesthetic. However it is getting picked up again by contemporary designers and slowly it starts to get political meaning again.
