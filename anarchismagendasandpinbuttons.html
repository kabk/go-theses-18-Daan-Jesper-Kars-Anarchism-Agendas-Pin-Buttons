			The field I'm interested in is the punk rock movement of the 80's/90's. Not only the music scene but the inner-core why this movement was created: to change the political agenda and get rid of fascism in general, by using different kinds of mediums to convey their message.

			<blockquote>Many comparisons can be found in graphic design nowadays. For instance: the DIY (do it yourself), taking position in society and letting others hear their voice. Once Hank Peirce wrote an article named: Punk is Dead. In that article he says: <span style="font-style:italic">Don't follow us, don't do what we did, just learn from our mistakes. Beware the traps of consumerism that we stepped into.</span> I believe that we, the (graphic) designers, are the movement that should follow up the punk rock movement.
			<br>
			<blockquote>By researching both topics, punk-rock movement & being a political designer in this era, I want to show and prove that we, the designers, are capable of creating changes. Maybe not completely, but I do believe that a good designed project can be the beginning of a change in society and maybe even cause a revolution.
